# Mimicry Quality Assessment Table (trait table)


This directory contains data and basic scripts for the Mimicry Quality Assessment Table, or Trait Table. The spreadsheet [`data/Raw data table.xlsx`](data/Raw%20data%20table.xlsx) contains the full compiled dataset. The file [`data/Raw data table.csv`](data/Raw%20data%20table.csv) contains a single sheet ("`Raw data`") from the spreadsheet, manually exported in CSV format.

The trait table requires no processing beyond the accuracy formula embedded in the spreadsheet. The R script [`R/Analysis.R`](R/Analysis.R) functions to convert the trait table data into a format compatible with the other methods in this project. It reads in the [`data/Raw data table.csv`](data/Raw%20data%20table.csv), averages values for species, and outputs [`output/Trait table-accuracy-species.csv`](output/Trait%20table-accuracy-species.csv). It also copies the output file into the global output directory, `../../output`. The script can be run from the command line or from Rstudio.
