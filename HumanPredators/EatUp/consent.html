  <h2>Participant Information and Consent Form</h2>
  
  <p>
    <span class="prj">Name of Project:</span>
    How do predators respond to insect and spider prey?
  <p>
You are invited to participate in a study of insects and spiders. The purpose of the study is
to understand predator responses to invertebrate prey such as insects and spiders, as
assessed by human observers.

  <p>
The study is being conducted by Prof Marie Herberstein (marie.herberstein@mq.edu.au;
98506276), Mr Jim (Donald) Mclean (donald.mclean@hdr.mq.edu.au; 98506279) and Mr
Michael Kelly (michael.kelly9@hdr.mq.edu.au; 98506279), all from the Department of
Biological Sciences, Macquarie University.

  <p>
Mr Mclean and Mr Kelly are PhD students and the research as being conducted will meet
the requirements of their PhDs under the supervision of Prof Marie Herberstein,
Department of Biological Sciences.

  <p>
If you decide to participate, you will be asked to view a number of images of insects and
spiders and tell us if you think they are ants or not. You will be asked to score a total of 30
images, and the task will take less than 3 minutes. From your responses we will obtain
the frequency with which each image is considered to be an ant as well as the time it took
each participant to score each image.

  <p>
Any information or personal details gathered in the course of the study are confidential,
except as required by law. No individual will be identified in any publication of the results.
A summary of the results of the data can be made available to you on request via email.
Participation in this study is entirely voluntary: you are not obliged to participate and if
you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without having to give a
reason and without consequence.

  <p>
The ethical aspects of this study have been approved by the Macquarie University Human
Research Ethics Committee. If you have any complaints or reservations about any ethical
aspect of your participation in this research, you may contact the Committee through the
Director, Research Ethics & Integrity (telephone (02) 9850 7854; email
